            <h1>A new report illustrates just how stuck the housing market is</h1>

                Just 2.5% of homes in the US changed hands this year in the first eight months, the lowest turnover rate in at least 30 years, according an analysis by Redfin.
               
               The latest data from the real estate brokerage underscores just how much the housing market has stalled in 2024 as Americans faced a toxic combination of record-high home prices and elevated mortgage rates, creating one of the most unaffordable housing markets in a generation. A rate cut by the Federal Reserve this month has fueled hopes that the interest rate-sensitive housing market will soon experience a fresh jolt.
               “What this data tells us is that the housing market in 2024 has been really frozen,” said Chen Zhao, Redfin’s economic research lead. “We said the same thing in 2023 and I think there was this expectation that it couldn’t get any worse, but 2024 has been disappointing for the housing market.”</p>

            <p>America’s housing crisis isn’t just reshaping where Americans live — experts say it’s reshaping how some vote.
                Many of the counties that swung most dramatically toward Donald Trump on Election Day were also among America’s toughest housing markets, according to an analysis of election returns and the NBC News Home Buyer Index. And while voters picked Trump for a variety of reasons, these counties shifted further right than much of the rest of the country.

            <h3>America’s prospective homebuyers absorb harsh reality: Mortgage rates probably aren’t coming down for a while</h3>
            <p>Many Americans have been holding back from jumping into the housing market in the hopes that mortgage rates will decline. So far, they haven’t.

                The average 30-year mortgage rate has been above 6% for two years — and is likely to stay above that level for the foreseeable future, experts say.

            <h3>More homeowners just started pulling cash out of their properties. Here's why.</h3>
            <p>U.S. homeowners are sitting on a record amount of equity, but higher interest rates over the past two years have made them reluctant to tap into it. That is finally starting to change.

                In the third quarter of this year, mortgage holders withdrew $48 billion of home equity, according to ICE Mortgage Technology — the largest volume in the two years since the Federal Reserve started hiking its benchmark interest rate. While mortgage rates don’t exactly follow the Fed’s rate, home equity lines of credit, or HELOCs, are tied to it. The Fed cut.</p>

            <h2>Rapidly rising rents squeeze millions in the middle class</h2>
            <p>Rent costs have long weighed on lower-income households — now it’s coming for the middle class. 

                Nearly 4 in 10 middle-class renter households are burdened by costs, an NBC News analysis of Census Bureau data found. That’s up almost 20% since 2019, while the already high share of cost-burdened, low-income households rose just 2%. A cost-burdened household is defined as one paying 30% or more of pretax income on rent and housing costs. This figure is widely used as a threshold for affordability: the Census Bureau measures housing costs against it, and the Department of Housing and Urban Development has used it for decades.

                “If you’re spending more than 30% of your income on rent, it’s going to be harder to pay for everything else,” said Peter Hepburn, associate director of the Eviction Lab at Princeton University, “it makes you more vulnerable to all sorts of bad things.” While paying rent has always had its sting, experts say the tight housing market of recent years — which is also squeezing homebuyers — has caused the pain to bleed into new income brackets.</p>

            <h3>How hard is it to buy a home right now? The new NBC News Home Buyer Index measures the market</h3>
            <p>Why is it so hard to buy a home? Prices have far outpaced middle-class incomes. Mortgage rates are above 7% for the first time since 2002. And 3 out of 10 homes are sold above listing price.

                But none of those factors fully captures the variety of challenges buyers nationwide face in the current market. The conditions on the ground can vary widely across state and even county lines.

                Sales were 3.5% lower than in September 2023. Sales fell in three out of four U.S. regions, with just the West region seeing a gain.</p>

            <p>Homes are getting more affordable in some of the most populous counties that are up for grabs in the presidential race. But the improvements are incremental and may not yet register with most residents before they cast their ballots.

                For months, housing market conditions in a handful of battleground counties have been slightly less forbidding than in the U.S. overall, according to NBC News’ Home Buyer Index, which measures the relative difficulty of buying a home from one county to the next nationwide.

            <p>The share of middle-class Americans who are buying wallet-squeezing homes has more than doubled in the previous 10 years.

                Almost 30% of middle-class homeowners bought homes with monthly payments costing more than 30% of their income in 2022, an NBC News analysis of Census Bureau data found. That’s more than twice the share from 2013, with experts warning it leaves many households with less money for groceries and emergencies and less able to get ahead in the future.</p>

            <h2>Manufactured homes are surging in popularity — and you can order them on Amazon or Facebook</h2>
            <p>When Julie Johnson and her husband decided to purchase their own home, they turned to an unexpected place: Facebook Marketplace.

                One month and $52,000 later, a pre-owned 2,200 square-foot, four-bedroom, two-bathroom manufactured home was cut in half and delivered in two pieces on the back of a truck to her address in central North Carolina.
                
                Manufactured housing, sometimes called mobile homes, are homes made in a factory rather than constructed on site, and they have been surging in popularity this year amid America’s housing crisis.
                
                Elevated mortgage rates and a chronic shortage of homes in the US have pushed homeownership increasingly out of reach for many Americans, fueling their economic angst. A September CNN poll conducted by SSRS found that the cost of housing was the most important economic issue for nearly one-fourth of likely voters who rent their homes. As of September, the median existing-home sales price in America was $404,500, marking the 15th consecutive month of year-over-year price increases, according to the National Association of Realtors.</p>

            <h2>You need to make $108,000 to afford a home in America</h2>
            <p>
                In most US cities, buying a home now requires a six-figure salary.
                
                A household needed to earn $107,700 to afford a new single-family home and pay property taxes and insurance costs in the third quarter of this year, according to a new report from Oxford Economics. That’s nearly double the household income of $56,800 needed to afford a new home in 2019.
                
                The report highlights just how difficult it has become, in a matter of just a few years, for Americans to afford purchasing a new home. Just 36% of US households earned enough to afford a new home, compared to 59% in Q3 2019.
                
                But the world looks different than it did five years ago. In 2020, the pandemic disrupted the overall economy — the housing market included. The pandemic led many Americans to move, seeking more spacious homes. A shortage of homes in the US, combined with increased demand, helped create intense competition, leading to skyrocketing home prices in cities across America.
                
                While the report found that home prices increased in every US city, location still matters. San Jose, California, was the least affordable US metro region, with a median house price of $1.89 million in Q3 2024 and an income of $461,000 needed to afford a home. Other California cities, including San Francisco, Los Angeles and San Diego, were among the least affordable metros.</p>
